            Brotherhood of American Yeomen (acronym, BAY; originally, Farmer's Mutual), was a coeducational North American secret fraternal benefit society organized in 1897. In 1932, the organization was changed to Yeomen Mutual Life Insurance Company, a mutual, legal reserve, level premium company later known as AmerUs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Brotherhood of American Yeomen (BAY) was a coeducational North American secret fraternal benefit society.  J.E. and C.B. Paul established BAY as Farmer's Mutual on February 25, 1897, at Bancroft, Iowa. Its name was changed to the Brotherhood of American Yeomen before its articles of incorporation were filed. It had chapters across the United States and also had members in Canada. It furnished family protection; there was also a juvenile department (for children of age 1–16). Men and women were admitted on equal terms.<br/><br/>Within the years 1917 to 1923, the BAY had effected a complete reversal of its former inadequate rate policy and set itself towards complete solvency. To provide an immediate funeral benefit, the Brotherhood attached a funeral coupon check to each of its new Class C certificates.
