            The 1996 Padilla car crash occurred in Okinawa, Japan, on 7 January 1996. Lori Padilla, a member of the United States Marine Corps in Okinawa, was speeding in a car which swerved off the road, killing Rojita Kinjo and her young daughters Mitsuko and Mariko. The crash sparked outrage in Okinawa and strengthened opposition to the U.S. military presence in Japan, which was already facing scrutiny over the 1995 Okinawan rape incident that occurred only a few months earlier.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Crash ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>At around 1 p.m. on Sunday, January 7, 1996, a car driven by Lori Padilla, a 20-year-old Lance Corporal of the United States Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa as part of the United States Forces Japan, crashed at the Kitamae gate to Camp Foster on Route 58, located on Okinawa Island in Japan. The car struck and killed Rojita Kinjo, a 36-year-old Japanese civilian, and her two young daughters, 10-year-old Mitsuko and 1-year-old Mariko. Padilla and passenger Carrie Smith, a 21-year-old Private First Class in the US Marines, were slightly injured and taken to a United States Navy hospital. <br/><br/>Okinawa police stated that Padilla had abruptly changed lanes and lost control of her car because she was driving too fast. The US military was criticized for refusing requests by the Japanese authorities for access to Padilla or to administer a breathalyzer test, as standard Japanese procedure calls for alcohol testing to rule out drunk driving as the cause of the crash. The incident brought to light one of many grievances felt by the people of Okinawa towards the US military presence on the island chain, and after the Padilla crash it was revealed that over a thousand car crashes involving US military personnel occurred in Okinawa per year.
