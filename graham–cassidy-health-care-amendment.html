            Graham–Cassidy (sometimes written as Cassidy–Graham) or Graham–Cassidy–Heller–Johnson is the common name for Senate Amendment 1030 (S.Amdt. 1030) to the American Health Care Act of 2017 (H.R. 1628). S.Amdt. 1030 was introduced on September 13, 2017, sponsored by Lindsey Graham (R-SC), with Bill Cassidy (R-LA) as a co-sponsor, after whom the amendment is named. The other three co-sponsors are Dean Heller (R-NV), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Roy Blunt (R-MO). The amendment would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. It would also return control of the Medicaid program to the states and cap the program's funding. The amendment would also redistribute federal money differently to different states, with some states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA (which are generally Democratic) losing federal money to states that did not (which are generally Republican).<br/><br/>In May 2017, late night comedy host Jimmy Kimmel shared with his audience that his son was born with tetralogy of Fallot, a birth defect of the heart. Shortly after, Cassidy began claiming that he wanted any health care bill to pass what he dubbed the "Jimmy Kimmel test," which he defined as "would a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything he or she would need in that first year of life?" Most analysts of the bill stated that this bill violated the test, which led Kimmel to condemn it on his show and urge his viewers to contact their representatives to oppose it.
