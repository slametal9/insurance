            Tower is a New Zealand and Pacific insurance company that provides car, home, contents, business, boat, pet, travel and other general insurance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1869 the New Zealand Government provided the capital for the creation of the New Zealand Government Life Insurance Department (better known simply as Government Life). It became Tower Corporation in 1987 at a time when several New Zealand government departments and organisations were being corporatised or converted into state-owned enterprises. Three years later, ownership of Tower was transferred to policyholders as the business was mutualised.<br/><br/>Being a mutual caused difficulties in raising capital and nine years later, in 1999, Tower demutualised and listed on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. Seven years later, in November 2006, Tower's Australian and New Zealand operations were separated with the approval of its shareholders and the high court. Today Tower is still shareholder-owned and listed on the NZX and ASX.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Diversification from plain life insurance ===<br/><br/>In 1989, Tower bought the National Insurance Company of New Zealand Limited. Originally founding its Head Office in Dunedin in 1873, the National Insurance Company had now grown its operations throughout the world. National Insurance had bought the failed Standard Insurance Company Limited in 1961. These businesses provided Tower's fire and general insurance divisions.
