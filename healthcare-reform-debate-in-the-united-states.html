            The healthcare reform debate in the United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Details ==<br/><br/>During the presidency of Barack Obama, who campaigned heavily on accomplishing health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted in March 2010.<br/><br/>In the 2016 administration, President Donald Trump said during the election that the healthcare system should work based on free market principles. He endorsed a seven-point plan for healthcare reform:<br/><br/><br/><br/>repeal Obamacare<br/><br/>reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance<br/><br/>institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals<br/><br/>make Health Saving Accounts inheritable<br/><br/>require price transparency<br/><br/>block-grant Medicaid to the states<br/><br/>allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers<br/><br/>He also suggested that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs.<br/><br/>The Trump administration made efforts to repeal the ACA and replace it with a different healthcare policy (known as a "repeal and replace" approach), but it never succeeded in doing so through Congress. Next, the administration joined a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ACA, and the Supreme Court agreed at the beginning of March 2020 that it would hear the case. Under normal scheduling, the case would be heard in the fall of 2020 and decided in the spring of 2021. However, as the Supreme Court subsequently went on hiatus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it is unclear when the case will be heard.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cost debate ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>U.S. healthcare costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%).
