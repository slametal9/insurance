            The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America is one of the largest mutual life insurance companies in the world. Based in Manhattan, it has approximately 8,000 employees in the United States, and a network of over 3,000 financial representatives in more than 70 agencies nationwide. As of 2018, it ranks 239th on the Fortune 500 list of largest American corporations by revenue. In 2015, Guardian achieved the highest earnings in its 155-year history with $7.3 billion in capital and $1.5 billion in operating costs. Founded in Manhattan in 1860, the company offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including life insurance, disability income insurance, annuities, investments, and dental and vision insurance coverage.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guardian founder Hugo Wesendonck, a German civil rights lawyer, participated in the 1848-49 revolution and helped draft a constitution for a united Germany. Accused of treason, he fled post-revolution Europe and landed in the U.S. With start-up funds from fellow German refugees, he opened Germania Life Insurance Company in 1860 on Wall Street in Manhattan, to cover the growing number of German immigrants arriving on American shores. Two years later, he opened a branch in San Francisco, and later across the country, reaching territories such as Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, and South Dakota.<br/><br/>In 1868, Germania became the first U.S. insurance company to start an agency in Europe. By the early 20th century, almost half its business was outside North America, until the pressures of World War I forced it to stop its business in Europe.
