            The Pyramids are three 11-story, pyramid-shaped office buildings that are part of a 200-acre (810,000 m2) commercial development in the College Park neighborhood area of Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The structures occupy 40 acres (16 hectares) of land situated next to a 25-acre (10-hectare) lake. They were constructed between 1967 and 1972 by the College Life Insurance Company (now part of Americo Life) using a design by architect Kevin Roche. They are noted for the abstract quality of the opacity of the concrete walls that face the nearby highway and the reflectivity of the glass curtain walls that face the landscaped grounds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In the 1960s, the College Life Insurance Company was rapidly expanding and sought to accommodate its growing staff while providing for anticipated expansion. It decided on a plan by Kevin Roche consisting of nine identical office towers each eleven stories tall and each containing 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2). This would permit it to build towers as it needed additional office space without leaving buildings idle or underused. Only the initial three towers were constructed and took the form of pyramids. In the late-1990s, the site was re-landscaped and further construction of towers appeared unlikely. In 2004, Sterling American Property purchased the office center for US$10 million.
