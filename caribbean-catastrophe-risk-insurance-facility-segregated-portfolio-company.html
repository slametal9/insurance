<h1>Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility Segregated Portfolio Company</h1>
            
            Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility Segregated Portfolio Company (CCRIF SPC) is an insurance company headquartered in the Cayman Islands. The sixteen original member-countries of CCRIF included participants in CARICOM, and the membership of the Board of Directors is selected by CARICOM and by the Caribbean Development Bank.<br/><br/>Founded in 2007, CCRIF is the first multi-country risk pool in the world, and was the first insurance instrument to successfully develop parametric policies backed by both traditional and capital markets. These parametric policies release funds based upon factors of a calamity such as rainfall or wind speed, which can speed up the payout of policies rather than after damages are assessed. Unused funds are kept as reserves for the CCRIF. The fund can also draw upon $140 million in funds underwritten by reinsurance.<br/><br/>Other regions have since setup similar government disaster instance including in the African Union and the Pacific Islands Forum.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>From 2004 through 2007, planning to create the Caribbean Regional Risk Insurance Facility, or CCRIF, was performed under the technical leadership of the World Bank with a grant from the Government of Japan. In 2007, CCRIF offered its first parametric insurance products, earthquake and tropical cyclone.<br/><br/>In 2007, CCRIF made its first payout to the governments of St Lucia and Dominica for the earthquake on November 29, and in 2008, CCRIF made its first payout to the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands in response to damage from Hurricane Ike.<br/><br/>During its early years of operation, day-to-day operations of CCRIF were handled by Caribbean Risk Managers Limited (CaribRM), who acted as the facility supervisor.
