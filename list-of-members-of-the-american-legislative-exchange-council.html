<h1>List of members of the American Legislative Exchange Council</h1>
            
            The American Legislative Exchange Council, otherwise known by the acronym ALEC, is a non-profit 501(c) political organization established in 1973 in Chicago. The legislative members are state and federal legislators. It is a forum to allow the members to write model laws and discuss legislative language with other members. ALEC meetings are an opportunity for the corporate and non-profit leaders to meet and provide feedback to legislators.  Member legislators can then use these model bills as templates for their own bills.<br/><br/>ALEC's vision statement is "A nonpartisan membership association for conservative state lawmakers who shared a common belief in limited government, free markets, federalism, and individual liberty. Their vision and initiative resulted in the creation of a voluntary membership association for people who believed that government closest to the people was fundamentally more effective, more just, and a better guarantor of freedom than the distant, bloated federal government in Washington, D.C."<br/><br/>ALEC keeps its membership, activities and communications confidential.  This list includes members whose identity primarily has become known through internal documents revealed to Common Cause and by research by members of the press.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Board of Scholars ==<br/><br/>The ALEC Board of Scholars is composed of the following:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Arthur Laffer, founder and chairman of Laffer Associates, an economic research and consulting firm<br/><br/>Victor Schwartz, partner in the Washington office of the Kansas City-based law firm Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon, LLP, and chair of its Public Policy Group.<br/><br/>Richard Vedder, Distinguished Professor of Economics at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio<br/><br/>Bob Williams, founder and senior fellow of the Freedom Foundation (Washington), a public policy organization in Olympia, Washington.
