            William Ridley Wills (September 19, 1871 – November 21, 1949) was a founder of the National Life and Accident Insurance Company in Nashville in 1902. Born in west Tennessee, Wills came to Nashville in 1893 to serve as Tennessee's deputy commissioner of insurance. There he met C.A. Craig and C. Runcie Clements and the three men formed the National Life and Accident Company after purchasing another insurance company which was being sold at auction. The new company sold health and accident insurance policies to industrial workers, a large percentage of whom were African-American. The company grew and moved into a large stone building in downtown Nashville where, in 1925, it launched radio station WSM which won international fame in creating the broadcast the "Grand Ole Opry". Wills died of a stroke in 1949. His nephew (identically named) was poet and novelist William Ridley Wills, and his grandson is author and historian William Ridley Wills II.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>He was born in 1871 in Brownsville, a town in western Tennessee in the coastal plain between Memphis and Jackson. His parents were Haywood County pioneers. His father was a surgeon, Dr. William Thaddeus Wills, who served under the command of Nathan Bedford Forest in the Civil War.
