            God Bless America is a 2011 American action black comedy film written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait. Combining elements of political satire with dark humor, the film stars Joel Murray and Tara Lynne Barr as a middle-aged man and a teenage girl who go on a killing spree after bonding over their disgust of what American culture has become in a post-9/11 world.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>Frank Murdoch is a middle-aged insurance salesman who is sick of how America has fallen into a state of depravity based on pop culture, TV, the Internet, and talk radio. He fantasizes about killing his neighbors, whose screaming baby worsens his migraines and keeps him awake all night. The following day, the neighbor blocks his old car with their sports car, and he is frustrated when they act like he is imposing by asking them to move it. Meanwhile, Frank's ex-wife Alison has custody of their daughter Ava, who has become a spoiled brat. Frank is fired when he obtains a co-worker's address without permission to send her roses after she tells him she is feeling down. His uninterested doctor later tells him that he has a terminal brain tumor.<br/><br/>That evening, Frank watches television, and his attention is caught by American Superstarz, a talent show featuring an intellectually disabled man named Steven Clark, who the judges mock for his attempts at singing. Frank prepares to shoot himself but stops when he sees a reality show about Chloe, an extremely spoiled teenager, which gives him an epiphany.
