<h1>Medical underwriting</h1>
            
            Medical underwriting is a health insurance term referring to the use of medical or health information in the evaluation of an applicant for coverage, typically for life or health insurance. As part of the underwriting process, an individual's health information may be used in making two decisions: whether to offer or deny coverage and what premium rate to set for the policy. The two most common methods of medical underwriting are known as moratorium underwriting, a relatively simple process, and full medical underwriting, a more in-depth analysis of a client's health information. The use of medical underwriting may be restricted by law in certain insurance markets. If allowed, the criteria used should be objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance system.<br/><br/>It is the process in which an underwriter considers the health conditions of the person who is applying for the insurance, keeping in mind certain factors like health condition, age, nature of work, and geographical zone. After looking at all the factors, an underwriter suggests whether a policy should be given to the person and at what price, or premium.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Health insurance ==<br/><br/>Underwriting is the process that a health insurer uses to weigh potential health risks in its pool of insured people against potential costs of providing coverage.<br/><br/>To search the medical underwriting, an insurer asks people who apply for coverage (typically people applying for individual or family coverage) about pre-existing medical conditions. In most US states, insurance companies are allowed to ask questions about a person's medical history to decide whom to offer coverage, whom to deny and if additional charges should apply to individually-purchased coverage.
