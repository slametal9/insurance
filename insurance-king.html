            Insurance King Agency, Inc., dba Insurance King, is an Illinois-based insurance agency.<br/><br/>The agency is headquartered in Rockford, Illinois and is currently owned by Daniel Block. The agency, then called Nyman Advisors, Inc., was created in 2000 by co-founders Scot Nyman and Dan Block, and was renamed to Insurance King in 2001. The agency handles auto and motorcycle insurance, along with SR-22s and roadside assistance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 2000, Block would become an insurance agent for a competing agency, when he learned that other insurance carriers had lower insurance rates. In the same year, Block would run into Scot Nyman, who had recently started his own agency. While having lunch one day with Nyman, Block would eventually decide to leave his employer work for Nyman's agency, Nyman Advisors, Inc.<br/><br/>In 2001, Nyman Advisors would undergo a name change to become Insurance King, after a salesman complimented the agency to Block and called Block "The Insurance King". The name stuck with Block, and he would eventually change the name of the agency to "Insurance King".<br/><br/>In March 2003, Block would buy the agency from Nyman, making Block the sole owner of Insurance King.
