            ManhattanLife (originally The Manhattan Life Insurance Company), is an American life insurance company domiciled in New York.  It  operates as a subsidiary of Manhattan Life Group in Houston, Texas. ManhattanLife is the brand name for plans, products, and services provided by one or more of the subsidiaries and affiliate companies of Manhattan Life Group Inc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early years ===<br/><br/>Manhattan Life was incorporated on May 29, 1850, capitalizing on the recent trend of buying life insurance. Alonzo Alvord was its first President, a serial entrepreneur who started as a haberdasher, had been an insurance agent and insurance company officer for about three years, and dabbled in politics.<br/><br/>After the New York Deposit Law was passed in 1851, Manhattan Life created a joint-stock company.  The goal was to provide corporate stability by creating a board of directors with a financial interest in the management.  The new corporate structure protected the interests of policyholders by creating a mutual system whose profits belong to the insured. As an additional safeguard, one-half of the directors were to be policyholders whose premiums were at least $100 per year and all policyholders whose premiums equaled or exceeded $75 were entitled to vote. The company was successful and maintained a favorable record.
