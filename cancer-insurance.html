            Cancer insurance is a type of supplemental health insurance that is meant to manage the risks associated with the cancer disease and its numerous manifestations. Cancer insurance is a relatively new trend within the insurance industry. It is meant to mitigate the costs of cancer treatment and provide policyholders with a degree of financial support. This support is based upon the terms written into a particular policy by an insurance company. As with other forms of insurance, cancer insurance is subject to charges, called premiums, which change depending on the risk associated with covering the disease.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In terms of the insurance industry, cancer insurance is a novel form of coverage, having emerged approximately 50 years ago. This coverage was created by insurers like the American Heritage Life Insurance Company and Aflac to meet demand coming from those suffering from the disease. Cancer insurance was not designed to replace conventional health insurance coverage. Instead, this type of insurance is meant to augment conventional policies by providing coverage for a disease that is often associated with high out-of-pocket medical costs, even when coverage is provided through traditional insurance policies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Types of Policies ==<br/><br/>Most cancer policies fall into two distinct types of plans: Scheduled benefits policies and lump sum policies.
